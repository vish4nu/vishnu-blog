### Bye Bye America!

I applied for this job back in December 2019, well before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the United States. I had always mused about working in New Zealand or another country, and saw the perfect opportunity to pursue this dream while I still had little tying me down towards the end of residency. I applied through a locums company and actually ended up getting an ER position in a hospital in Hawke's Bay on the north island. I will be living in a little art deco inspired beach town called Napier, which apparently has the same weather as San Diego!

My contract actually doesnâ€™t start till August 24th, but before I can get up to shenanigans, I need to quarantine myself in Auckland as mandated by the NZ government. The plan is to leave for NZ in mid july and finish my 2 week quarantine by the end of the month. That way, I will have an entire three weeks to find myself a little campervan and travel the country before starting work. 

# Let the adventure begin!
