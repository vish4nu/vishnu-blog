## Welcome to my little blog 
---
For some time now, I have wanted to make a shift from content consumption to content creation, from lurker to poster in an attempt to improve my writing skills, my ability to articulate my thoughts and also to boost my creativity, all while learning some of the basics of web development. While this blog is largely for myself, I do also hope that those who come across it are able to take something away from its content as well. In a classic Vishnu style, this blog will likely contain a shit ton of typos, grammer and syntax errors. 

## ENJOY!
