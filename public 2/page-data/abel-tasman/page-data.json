And boy did it not disappoint. Located at the northwest end of the South Island, Abel Tasman National Park is a lush, green bay surrounded by beautifully calm and serene waters with little islands dotting the coastline. Thanks to COVID-19 and the lack of tourists, I had what many would describe as a once in a lifetime experience being the ONLY tourist that day in Abel Tasman ( I would later find out that there were actually a couple other tourists but they were already away on a several day backpacking journey deep in the forest when I arrived). I drove into Maharu, the last little town at the very tip of the forest to find eerie silence and a majority of the stores shuttered. To my relief, there was one kayak adventure store still open. With their help, I was able to get a guide who agreed to take me me kayaking in the park. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"My kayaking companion and guide was Jessica O\\u2019Conner, who I\\u2019d later learn was a celebrity of sorts. But more on that in a bit. We pack our gear and our lunches and make our way to the boat dock where we begin our little half day expedition along the outer edges of the park. I sat in the front of the kayak while Jessica helped steer us from behind. As the town of Maharu got further and further from us, the beauty of Able Tasman began to really reveal itself. Holy moly it was like something out of a movie. The sky was bright blue and reflected against the crystal clear waters of the bay. The water was so translucent that you could see nearly see the bottom. But what made the experience particularly memorable was the fact that we were literally the only people on the water that day, something Jessica pointed out almost never happened. Normally, the guided tours would comprise of 15-20 kayaks (especially in the busy summers) but the off-season and COVID had nearly wiped out the tourist economy.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"span\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"display\": \"block\",\n      \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n      \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n      \"maxWidth\": \"960px\"\n    }\n  }), \"\\n      \", mdx(\"span\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"span\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"paddingBottom\": \"70.41666666666667%\",\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"bottom\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\",\n      \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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')\",\n      \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n      \"display\": \"block\"\n    }\n  })), \"\\n  \", mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"span\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n    \"alt\": \"Abel Tasman National Park\",\n    \"title\": \"Abel Tasman National Park\",\n    \"src\": \"/static/dce1dfc6282a052d0ad81f47f448e5d9/18e3b/abel.jpg\",\n    \"srcSet\": [\"/static/dce1dfc6282a052d0ad81f47f448e5d9/46946/abel.jpg 240w\", \"/static/dce1dfc6282a052d0ad81f47f448e5d9/55489/abel.jpg 480w\", \"/static/dce1dfc6282a052d0ad81f47f448e5d9/18e3b/abel.jpg 960w\", \"/static/dce1dfc6282a052d0ad81f47f448e5d9/60e21/abel.jpg 1440w\", \"/static/dce1dfc6282a052d0ad81f47f448e5d9/69b48/abel.jpg 1920w\", \"/static/dce1dfc6282a052d0ad81f47f448e5d9/1a3a8/abel.jpg 5518w\"],\n    \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"width\": \"100%\",\n      \"height\": \"100%\",\n      \"margin\": \"0\",\n      \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n      \"position\": \"absolute\",\n      \"top\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\"\n    },\n    \"loading\": \"lazy\"\n  })), \"\\n    \")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We paddled our way along the shore and found an isolated beach on which to have a lunch break.

By day 8 of what was supposed to be a 4 day trip, the duo was completely out of food, but managed to find a creek to obtain fresh water. With their energy nearly depleted and no way to make it out, they decided to stay put near the creek so that they could at least have access to water while they waited to be rescued. I asked Jessica whether she ever worried about whether the rescuers would find her in time. She mentioned that the hardest part about the entire experience was in fact not the lack or food or the prospect of not being rescued. She could hear helicopters during the day time looking for them and was convinced that they would be found. What Jessica found truly challenging was dealing with her backpacking partner/friend. As they got desperate, her relationship with her friend had started to fray and emotions flared. The friend was convinced that they need to keep moving. However, being an experienced backpacker, Jessica knew that their best chances of being rescued laid in conserving their energy and staying by the creek till they were rescued. Convincing her partner of the same ended up being an incredibly challenging endeavor and a traumatizing experience.
