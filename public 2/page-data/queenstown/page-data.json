The hike ended at a dope little cafe on top of a hill. It was also the starting point for a zip-lining course and a ?luge course. I had no idea what a luge was but apparently its a downhill track where one can drive little toy cars down at high speeds - so basically downhill gocarting. GOT IT! The Cafe had a panoramic balcony that offered SUPER DOPE views of the either town, lake and the mountains that surrounded it. It was a perfect way to start of the day! I got a little coffee up top, enjoyed the views, snapped some pics and slowly made my way down. By this time, I had worked up a nice little appetite. My lonely planet guide directed me to a yum little burger/sandwich joint called Fergberger. It was a small shop that was surprisingly crowded, though I was able to get my falafel sandwich pretty fast. I would later find out that Fergberger is one of those spots that normally has huge lines out the door and one often has to way almost an hour to get their food on a normal day.
