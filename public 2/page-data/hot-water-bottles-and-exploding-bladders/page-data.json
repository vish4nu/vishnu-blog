It was definitely a bit chilly but the double comfortor situation totally helped!! On top of that, Garth also came with this little green hot water bottle that was a lifesaver!!! It was my first time ever using a hot water bottle. In fact, I hadn\\u2019t seen one since my grandma used to use it on her ?back when I was a weee little kid in India. I remember her\\u2019s being red in color. To be honest, I didn\\u2019t really think the hot water bottle would add much in terms of heat but boy was I wrong!! The thing is MAGIC! I basically filled it up with hot water and either hugged it against my chest or placed it between my thighs. The bottle not only warmed my body up, but also ended up hot-boxing the sheets as it radiated heat outward. BRILLIANT! I LOVE THIS THING!! No wonder my pati (Tamil for grandma)  used it so often! Damn you old lady for not sharing your wisdom with me sooner. I need to get myself one of these when I get back to the US! \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In earnest, the hardest part was not going to sleep, but getting out of bed.\\nI woke up the next morning all cozy in my hotboxed sheets and was enjoying being lazy and staying wrapped up in the warmth of my blankets. However, my annoying ass bladder had decided that it had waited long enough and was threatening to override my urinary sphincter if I didn\\u2019t get my ass out of bed NOW and make a dash to the bathroom. Oh. My. God. The moment I took that comforter off suckkkked! My body instantly went from all warm and fuzzy to freezing in an instant. It reminded me of that feeling when you are getting into ocean or a cold pool and your testicles finally submerge in the water - ITS THE WORST! But the good news is that it only lasts a few seconds and then you forgot it even happened, till the next morning when your bladder decides it needs to explode again. \"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","excerpt":"So… first night in the van… NOT BAD!!
