I met alberto at the international housing at UCSD. He was living with Liam Boogar, another old suitmate of mine from freshman year of college. Alberto was a kind, soft spoken and unassuming human with incredible depth and perceptive abilities. We bonded because we both played the sitar. I remember being surprised to find an Italinan studying in the US who even knows about the Sitar, let alone how to play it. Alberto and I stayed in touch and I actually went and visited him towards the end of college when I was studying abroad in Sweden (2009). The name of the little town he lived in escapes me (I think it started witha ?P) but I remember it being near Bologna. We were hosted by his family who cooked us this AMAZING italian musroom risotto meal followed by little espressos shots that he made using his stove-top espresso maker. Alberto was gracious enough to share his risotto recipe with me and even gave me his single shot stove-top espresso to take home as a souvenir. Alberto and I unfortunately lost touch but I hope to catch up with him again sometime. use I still use the espresso maker he gave me to this very day.
